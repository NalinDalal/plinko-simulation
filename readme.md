# Building a gambling website and game analysis

Online gambling platforms rely on a mathematical edge and controlled randomness to ensure long-term profitability.
This repository analyzes both the technical and probabilistic foundations of such systems — from frontend physics simulations to backend randomness and fairness validation.

This project explores the **mechanics, fairness, and determinism** behind online gambling platforms — including **game physics simulation, backend odds management**, and **client-server synchronization** for secure gameplay.
It also provides insights into **probability theory, hackability**, and the **mathematical inevitability of loss** in gambling systems.

## Key Topics Covered

### Game Mechanics & Determinism

- Implementation of **deterministic physics** for a “Plinko-style” gambling game.
- Ball simulation with **gravity, friction, and collision** on an HTML `<canvas>`.
- Ensuring consistent results across devices using **frame-based rendering** (time-independent simulation).

### Security & Hackability

- Understanding **why client-side games are hackable** (due to exposed JavaScript logic).
- Explanation of **why the backend must always be the source of truth** for fairness.
- Strategies for **server reconciliation** — verifying user actions (direction, time, etc.) without trusting client input.

### Probabilities & Casino Advantage

- Deep dive into **odds stacking** — how casinos design payout systems to ensure profitability.
- Example: A 3% increase in winning bets is insufficient to offset long-term loss probability (≈ 1/25).
- Demonstration of **mathematical expectation** leading to guaranteed casino profit in the long run.

### Backend Simulation & Control

- Pre-computation of **ball drop paths** to map multipliers and outcomes.
- Backend API controlling:
  - Drop origin
  - Multiplier outcomes
  - Player balance updates

- Deterministic game design ensures **repeatable simulations** for verification and fairness audits.

### Frontend Rendering

- Built using **HTML + Canvas** for performant and dynamic animation.
- Continuous rendering with `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth playback.
- Visual simulation of balls, obstacles, and sinks (multiplier slots).

### Physics Engine

- Controlled parameters:
  - Gravity (realistic vertical acceleration)
  - Friction (horizontal dampening)
  - Collision detection (circle-circle intersection)

- Mathematical functions (`Math.hypot`, vector direction updates) simulate realistic bounce behavior.

## Client–Server Architecture

| Component             | Responsibility                                            | Security Role                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Frontend**          | Renders game visuals, collects user actions               | Never trusted for randomness |
| **Backend**           | Generates deterministic outcomes, handles bets & balances | Source of truth              |
| **Simulation Engine** | Runs identical physics for validation                     | Ensures reproducibility      |
| **Database**          | Stores outcomes & user multipliers                        | Tracks fairness & audit logs |

## Determinism & Fairness

Deterministic systems ensure:

- Consistent outcomes across identical inputs.
- Resistance to timing-based hacks.
- Auditability for fairness testing.

### Design Guidelines

- Avoid floating-point physics (use **frame-based** steps).
- Ignore real-time deltas — rely on **fixed update ticks**.
- Use integer-based position and velocity updates to prevent rounding errors.

## Probability of Losing

| Factor              | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-Term Luck** | Players may win temporarily.                                                    |
| **Long-Term Odds**  | Designed so probability of net loss ≈ 1/25 (or greater).                        |
| **House Edge**      | Even slight payout imbalance (e.g., 3% difference) guarantees profit over time. |

**Conclusion:**

> In the long run, players always lose — not due to rigging, but due to statistical inevitability.

## Learning Outcomes

- How client–server synchronization prevents cheating.
- How casinos maintain profitability through probability theory.
